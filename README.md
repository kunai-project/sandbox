# Kunai Sandbox

This project hosts a platform for sandboxing and analyzing malware samples using [Kunai](https://github.com/kunai-project/kunai). It is designed to support sandbox environments for both **x86_64** and **aarch64** architectures, enabling users to safely isolate malware samples and generate real-world data for threat analysis.

A key feature is the generation of detailed Kunai traces and network traffic dumps, providing detection engineers with direct access to critical insights such as behavioral patterns, system-level activities, and network interactions. This actionable data simplifies the creation of detection rules and significantly accelerates the development of effective defenses against emerging threats.
